**To complete this Hands-on Lab you will need to:**

1- To download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on your local machine.

2- To download and install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

3- To download and install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

4- Create an account on [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/RHOS-webinar).

5- Create your [Watson-Language-Translator](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/language-translator/) instance.

## Clone this Repo.

- Open your cmd/terminal.

1. Type `mkdir docker-demo`

2. Next, change to the newly created directory by issuing `cd docker-demo`

3. Finally, Clone the repo `https://github.com/samerfouad/Watson-Docker.git`

4. `cd Watson-Docker.git`

## Configure Watson Language Translator API with our App.

1. Import the cloned repo to your preffered IDE.
2. Go to `server.js` and update Line **10** with your newly generated LT API Endpoint.
3. Save!


## Build the application with Docker!
1. You should have installed docker and now its Up and Running.
2. Get Back to the CMD.
3. Build your containerizaed version of the application using `docker build . -t translator:v1`
4. Start running the App with `docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "lt_key=<api_key>" translator:v1`
5. Change the `<api-key>` with the one generated by your Watson LT service instance.

## Try the Application.
- We will use Curl inorder to test our backend endpoint over `/translate` using `curl localhost:8080/translate?text=how+are+you` over the console.

## Output

- Now the text is translated into **Spanish** if you prefered to switch to another language, Please refer to [ Watson API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/language-translator/language-translator).
