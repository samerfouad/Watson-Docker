## Before you begin

**To complete this Hands-on Lab you will need to:**

1- Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on your local machine.

2- Download and install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

3- Download and install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

4- Create an account on [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/RHOS-webinar).

5- Create your [Watson-Language-Translator](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/language-translator/) instance.

## 1- Clone this Repo.

- Open your cmd/terminal.

1. Type `mkdir docker-demo`

2. Next, change to the newly created directory by issuing `cd docker-demo`

3. Finally, Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/samerfouad/Watson-Docker.git`

4. `cd Watson-Docker.git`

## 2- Configure Watson Language Translator API with the App.

1. Import the cloned repo in your preffered IDE.
2. Signin to IBM Cloud, then select **Catalog** as shown below: 
![IBM CLoud](assets/catalog.jpg "IBM Cloud Catalog")
3. Search for **Language Translator** service and create a new instance under your account:
![IBM CLoud](assets/translator-find.jpg "IBM Cloud LT")
![IBM CLoud](assets/translator-create.jpg "IBM Cloud LT Create")
4. Take a note of the newly generated LT API Key and URL.
2. Get back to `server.js` and update Line **10** with your newly generated LT API Endpoint.
3. Save!


## 3- Containerize the application with Docker!
1. You should have installed docker and now its Up and Running on your machine.
2. Get Back to the CMD/Terminal.
3. Build your containerizaed version of the application using `docker build . -t translator:v1`
4. Start running the App with `docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "lt_key=<api_key>" translator:v1`
5. Change the `<api-key>` with the one generated by your Watson LT service instance.

## 4- Try the Application.
- We will use Curl inorder to test our backend endpoint over `/translate` using `curl localhost:8080/translate?text=how+are+you` over the console.

## Output

- Now the text is translated into **Spanish**. if you prefered to switch to another language, Please refer to [ Watson API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/language-translator/language-translator).
